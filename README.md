## Summary

This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, the role of social media in shaping 
emotional experiences, and the growing concerns over screen time and problematic phone use. It includes a series of 
interactive visualizations built with D3.js, d3-cloud, and fullPage.js, which allow users to explore data and insights 
through engaging visual components. The goal of this project is to raise awareness about the intersection of mental 
health and technology and provide visual tools to better understand how screen time and social media usage affect 
emotional well-being.

## Features
- **Pandemic and Emotional Wellbeing BarChart**: This barchart demonstrates the DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) scores during the start of the pandemic (2019), 
and the peak of the pandemic (2020). Users can hover over each bar to see more insights regarding the corresponding category. 

- **Map Visualization (Screen Time)**：The map visualizes average screen time per country, with users able to zoom in to explore regional data. By hovering over a country or region, a tooltip appears with detailed statistics, including average daily screen time in hours. The visualization highlights key comparisons. The final section of the visualization provides a world map, allowing users to explore how average screen time has changed globally over the years.

- **Emotion Dashboard**：Displays the most common emotions expressed on social media platforms. Users can toggle between different platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram) and emotions, and view data in bar chart format. Both the barchart and bubble chart can be hovered over for more details.

- **Worldwide Search Trends**：Interactive line graphs showing the change in mental health-related search terms over time. Users can toggle between different search terms and hover over data points for detailed information. There is also a brushing function located under the graph that will allow users to select a specified time 
period to view.

- **Word Cloud**：The word cloud shows the most searched terms related to mental health, with hover functionality to display search volume for each term.

- **Bar Chart/Scatter Plot**：A toggle feature allows users to switch between a bar chart and a scatter plot to compare the search volume for mental health-related terms across different website establishment levels, with hover functionality on the scatter plot to display the search volume for each term.

A video tutorial is used to clarify the website's features.
